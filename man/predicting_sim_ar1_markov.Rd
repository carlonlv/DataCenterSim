\arguments{
\item{param}{A vector containing necessary informations or hyperparameters for AR1-Markov model.}

\item{dataset_max}{A \eqn{n \times m} matrix, with each column is the time series of maxes of CPU information on a machine.}

\item{dataset_avg}{A \eqn{n \times m} matrix, with each column is the time series of avges of CPU information on a machine.}

\item{training_policy}{\code{"once"} for offline training, \code{"fixed"} for training at fixed time, \code{"dynamic"} for training when previous performance is bad.}

\item{schedule_policy}{\code{"disjoint"} for scheduling at fixed time, \code{"dynamic"} for scheduling again immediately when failed.}

\item{adjust_policy}{\code{TRUE} for "backing off" strategy whenever a mistake is made.}

\item{cores}{The number of threads for parallel programming for multiple traces, not supported for windows users.}

\item{write_result}{TRUE if the result of the experiment is written to a file.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the resulting scheduling informations.

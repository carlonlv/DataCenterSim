\arguments{
\item{test_set_max}{The test set of max for scheduling and evaluations.}

\item{test_set_avg}{The test set of avg for scheduling and evaluations.}

\item{trained_result}{A list containing trained mean, coefficient, variance of residuals.}

\item{window_size}{The length of predictions.}

\item{cut_off_prob}{The maximum probability allowed to have next scheduling failing.}

\item{cpu_required}{A vector of length \eqn{m}, each element is the size of the job trying to be scheduled on corresponding machine.}

\item{granularity}{The granularity of 100 percent of total cpu.}

\item{schedule_policy}{\code{"disjoint"} for scheduling at fixed time, \code{"dynamic"} for scheduling again immediately when failed.}

\item{adjust_policy}{\code{TRUE} for "backing off" strategy whenever a mistake is made.}
}
\value{

\arguments{
\item{param_setting_sim}{A dataframe representing a specific parameter setting for sim object.}

\item{param_setting_pred}{A dataframe representing a specific parameter setting for pred object.}

\item{foreground_x}{A matrix of size n by m representing the target dataset for scheduling and evaluations.}

\item{foreground_xreg}{A matrix of size n by m representing the target dataset for scheduling and evaluations, or \code{NULL}.}

\item{lag_xreg}{A logical value representing whether the reggressor for foreground jobs needs to be lagged before applying the foreground model. Default value is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{sim_length}{A numeric integer representing the length of time for simulation, training size excluded.}

\item{use_adjustment}{A logical value controlling whether adjustment plicy will be used based on the previous foreground predictions, parameter setting \code{react_speed} will be used.}

\item{load_foreground_result}{A character value representing the location of the previously run foregound simulation results. Default value is \code{NULL}.}

\item{background_x}{A matrix of size n by m representing the target dataset for scheduling and evaluations.}

\item{background_xreg}{A matrix of size n by m representing the dataset that target dataset depends on for predicting.}

\item{load_background_result}{A character value representing the location of the previously run foregound simulation results. Default value is \code{NULL}.}

\item{num_jobs}{A numeric value represents the length of queue at each timestamp.}

\item{machines_full_indicator}{An numeric value that is used to identify whether all machines are full. The scheduler believes the machines are full after \code{machines_full_indicator} successive failures in scheduling.}

\item{heartbeats_percent}{A numeric value representing the percentage of sampled machines will periodically send "heat beats", which is the availability information to the scheduler. Default value is \code{1}.}

\item{constraint_prob}{A numeric value representing the cut off for survival probability of a job to be scheduled.}

\item{bins}{A numeric vector representing the discretization will be used on background job length, the first value representing the lower bound such as \code{0}, last value representing the upper bound such as \code{205}.}

\item{cores}{A numeric value representing the number of threads for parallel programming for multiple traces, not supported for windows users.}

\item{write_type}{A character that represents how to write the result of simulation, can be "detailed", "summary" or "none". Default value is \code{"none"}.}

\item{result_loc}{A character that specify the path to which the result of simulations will be saved to. Default is your work directory.}
